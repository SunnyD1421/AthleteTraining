This is Dylan Sund's Senior Data Analytics Capstone Project.

###### What is this project?
This project is a program for scheduling and tracking a team's training progress. A coach user is able to schedule workouts for their players and then see how they are progressing. 

The athletes will login and be able to find workouts with a calendar and be able to enter the corresponding data. 

###### What is the purpose?
Without this project, coaches may ask their players to write training data in journals or on other paper. My project not only provides a way for one coach to manage an entire team, but it also cuts down on the paper copies of workouts.
