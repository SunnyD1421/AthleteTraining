## Baseball Training data Manager
This is Dylan Sund's Senior Data Analytics Capstone Project.

###### What is this project?
This project is a program for scheduling and tracking a team's training progress. A coach user is able to schedule workouts for their players and then see how they are progressing. 

The athletes will login and be able to find workouts with a calendar and be able to enter the corresponding data. 

###### What is the purpose?
Without this project, coaches may ask their players to write training data in journals or on other paper. My project not only provides a way for one coach to manage an entire team, but it also cuts down on the paper copies of workouts.

### Usage
Before a program can begin to track their data, the athletes and coaches need to complete the signup form.
###### Coach
After all the athletes have signed up, a coach can do a few things:

> Add new exercises to the set of preloaded ones\n
> Add throwing and lifting plans\n
> Add a practice to the schedule for specific athletes
###### Athlete
After one of the coaches has scheduled a practice, the athlete can find this event on their dashboard. If there is throwing and lifting on the same day, they will be able to submit data for each practice separately.
